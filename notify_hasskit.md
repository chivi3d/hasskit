## 1. Setup a custom component

Download and unzip the folder notify_hasskit inside Home Assistant's custom_components folder like the following file structure:
```yaml
.homeassistant/
|-- custom_components/
|   |-- notify_hasskit/
|       |-- __init__.py
|       |-- manifest.json
|       |-- services.yaml
```

Click Share button and send yourself the token and add them to **.homeassistant/configuration.yaml**. Replace the "Notification Token Copy From Device 1" with the Notification Token Code in your phone:
```yaml
notify_hasskit:
  token:
    - "Notification Token Copy From Device 1"
    - "Notification Token Copy From Device 2"
    - "Notification Token Copy From Device 3"
```
## 3. Create a simple Automation

Open .homeassistant/automations.yaml and add the following lines. This will send a notification to your phone when the light turned on (replace light.light_1 with your light entity Id):
```yaml
- alias: HassKit Test Notification
  trigger:
    - entity_id: light.light_1
      platform: state
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: notify_hasskit.send
      data:
        device_index: 1
        title: "Light 1"
        body: "Turned On"
```

**Restart Home Assistant**

Use Developer Tools to send test notification:

For people use Node-Red instead of Home Assistant automation:
