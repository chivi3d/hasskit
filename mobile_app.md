First, we need to edit ***configuration.yaml*** by adding the following line:

Allow Home Assistant write file into www folder:
```
homeassistant:
  whitelist_external_dirs:
    - /config/www
```

Add notify.ALL_DEVICES service:
<br>
(Replace mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_1 with your registered device name)
```
notify:
  - name: ALL_DEVICES
    platform: group
    services:
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_1
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_2
      - service: mobile_app_hasskit_mobile_app_3
```

Send a notification whenever garage door is opened:
<br>
(Replace http://hasskit.duckdns.org:8123/local/camera_1.jpg with your own data)
```
automation:
  - alias: 'Notify when garage door opened'
    trigger:
    - entity_id: cover.garage_door
      platform: state
      to: "open"
    action:
    - data_template:
        entity_id: camera.camera_1
        filename: /config/www/camera_1.jpg
      service: camera.snapshot
    - delay:
        seconds: 1
    - data_template:
        title: Garage Door 
        message: Opened
        data:
          image: http://hasskit.duckdns.org:8123/local/camera_1.jpg
      service: notify.ALL_DEVICES   
```
